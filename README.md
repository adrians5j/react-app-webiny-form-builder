# What is this?

This a simple project created with Create React App, that shows how to render forms created with [Webiny Form Builder](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/introduction).

All of the relevant code is located in the `src/App.js` file, so, head over there first (additional comments included).
